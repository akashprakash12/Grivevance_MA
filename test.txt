1. 🧹 Remove all .pyc and __pycache__ files from Git tracking
In your project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
git rm --cached -r *.pyc
git rm --cached -r __pycache__/



2. ✍️ Commit the cleanup
bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Remove .pyc files and __pycache__ from repository"



3. 🚀 Push the cleaned version
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin thomas


Got it — since you've already committed and pushed .pyc files, we now need to remove them from the repository history to keep your project clean.
